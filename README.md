# News Reading App

A news reading application using Flutter. 

## Details

This application was made using flutter. The news fetching was done by "https://newsapi.org/". Used flutter_webview plugin to show the news inside the app. The collapsable appbar was created using the Listener widget which lets you know if the user is scrolling up or down. And with the help of animatedcontainer I achieved the rest.

## Features

- Get latest news of different categories.
- Pull to refresh the news feed.
- Instantly view the entire news page by just one click.
- Cache links for better loading next time.

** I made this in my lazy time. So don't judge :P
