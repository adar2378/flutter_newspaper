# News Reading App

A news reading application using Flutter.

## Details

This application was made using flutter. The news fetching was done by "https://newsapi.org/". Used flutter_webview plugin to show the news inside the app. The collapsable appbar was created using the Listener widget which lets you know if the user is scrolling up or down. And with the help of animatedcontainer I achieved the rest.
